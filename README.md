These are the files I worked with in my final project on the course “Data Analyst” from Skillbox
AB test - this is a Microsoft Word document with a report with all the work
AB_test_analysis - this is a file with code in which I worked, cleaned the data and merged them, there I worked with files:
Money - table with payments.
Cheaters - table with detected cheaters.
Platforms - table with game platforms (PC, PS4, Xbox).
Cash - table with in-game currency spending.
ABgroup - table with the distribution of players by test groups.
This file became the basis for the following ones:
1.AB_test_report.pbix - this is a file with graphs, which were built on the basis of the final cleaned, lunch data from the file "AB_test_analysis"
2.AB_test_results.xlsx - this is a file with a summary table in Microsoft Excel, which was built on the basis of the final cleaned, lunch data from the file "AB_test_analysis".
